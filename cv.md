## About me:
#### I graduated from the university with a degree in Information Security. While I was studying at the university, I realized that I like web development more. My first job was more related to layout and I wrote small scripts in js and Jquery. After that, I began to study Vue and moved to a new job. Now I want to fill in the gaps in my knowledge, since I learned most of the development myself and in the process.
